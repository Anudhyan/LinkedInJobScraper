# LinkedIn Job Scraper

A Python-based LinkedIn Job Scraper using Selenium to extract job listings for a given keyword and location.  
The scraper collects the following details for each job:

- **Job Title**  
- **Company Name**  
- **Location**  
- **Job Link**  
- **Date Posted**  

The extracted data is saved into a CSV file (`linkedin_jobs_sorted.csv`) sorted by the most recent postings.

---
