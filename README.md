# LinkedIn Job Scraper (Python + Selenium)

## 📌 Overview
I have developed a **LinkedIn Job Scraper** using **Python and Selenium** that automates the process of searching and extracting job postings from LinkedIn.  
The scraper logs into LinkedIn, performs keyword-based job searches, and collects useful details such as:

- ✅ Job Title  
- ✅ Company Name  
- ✅ Location  
- ✅ Job Link  

The extracted data is exported into a structured **CSV/Excel file** for easy analysis, helping streamline the job search process.
